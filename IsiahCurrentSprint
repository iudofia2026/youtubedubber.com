Isiah Current Sprint - October 15, 2025

The following frontend backlog items are in progress by Isiah. Do not pick these up:

1. Align backend responses with frontend DTOs
   - Owner: Isiah (frontend)
   - Summary: Normalize FastAPI job/job-status payloads to the existing TypeScript types via shared transformers in frontend/lib/api.ts.

2. Harden job detail polling & error handling
   - Owner: Isiah (frontend)
   - Summary: Improve app/jobs/[id]/page.tsx to handle API failures, stop polling once the job completes or errors, and surface friendly messaging.

3. Fix job list navigation to detail view
   - Owner: Isiah (frontend)
   - Summary: Update app/jobs/page.tsx so selecting a job routes to /jobs/{jobId} and removes the legacy console scaffolding.
