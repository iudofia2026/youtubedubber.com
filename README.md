## üéØ Current Status

- ‚úÖ **Frontend**: Complete UI implementation with authentication, job management, file upload, and mobile optimization. All major features implemented with mock data integration.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Backend**: Core FastAPI endpoints and models complete, but job processing pipeline still uses placeholder logic. Supabase integration ready but needs real API key configuration.
- üîÑ **Integration**: Ready for end-to-end testing. Development mode works with `dev-token` bypass; production requires Supabase configuration.
- üéØ **Next**: Replace mock API calls with real backend integration, implement actual job processing pipeline, and configure production Supabase credentials.
- ‚úÖ **MP4 Support**: Full MP4 video format support implemented with automatic audio extraction using FFmpeg.
- ‚úÖ **Authentication**: Complete Supabase Auth integration with login/register/profile management.
- ‚úÖ **Mobile Optimization**: Comprehensive mobile experience with touch optimization, swipe gestures, and haptic feedback.
