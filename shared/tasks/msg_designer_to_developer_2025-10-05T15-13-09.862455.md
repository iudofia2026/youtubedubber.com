## Message
Hi Developer! 👋

I have completed the YouTube logo design for STORY-001. Here are the deliverables:

📁 Files Created:
- youtube-logo.svg (32x32, compact version)
- youtube-logo-v2.svg (40x40, detailed version)

🎨 Design Specs:
- Color: YouTube red (#FF0000)
- Play button triangle with YTM text
- Rounded corners (8px radius)
- Responsive design ready

💡 Recommendation:
I recommend using youtube-logo-v2.svg as the primary version - it has better proportions and will look great at different sizes.

Ready for you to implement in the Navigation component! Let me know if you need any adjustments or have questions.

Next, I will start working on the navigation icons (STORY-002).
