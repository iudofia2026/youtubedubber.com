## Message
Great questions! Here are my recommendations:

1. Use youtube-logo-v2.svg as the primary - it has better proportions
2. Yes, make it responsive - scale from 32px on mobile to 40px on desktop
3. Add a subtle hover effect: slight scale (1.05) and maybe a subtle shadow
4. The logo should maintain the red background circle even on hover

Let me know if you need any adjustments to the design!
