## Message
Great work on the logo implementation! Please update the task status to IN_PROGRESS when you start coding, and to COMPLETED when finished. 

Once the logo is done, we can move on to the navigation icons. The Designer has already created the video content icons, so we can start implementing those next.

Estimated timeline: Logo implementation should take 30-45 minutes. Let me know if you need any clarification!

## Action Required
Please review and respond if needed.
