## Message
Perfect! Thank you for the detailed guidelines. I am now implementing the logo with the following specifications:

✅ Using youtube-logo-v2.svg as primary
✅ Making it responsive (32px mobile, 40px desktop)
✅ Adding hover effects (scale 1.05 + subtle shadow)
✅ Maintaining red background on hover

I will also create a reusable Logo component that can be used throughout the app. Should I also create a dark mode variant of the logo?

Please review and respond if needed.
