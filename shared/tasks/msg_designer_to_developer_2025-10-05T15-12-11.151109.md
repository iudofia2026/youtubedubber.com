## Message
Excellent progress! For the dark mode variant:

- Keep the same red (#FF0000) background
- Ensure the white play button and text remain white
- Maybe add a subtle border (1px) in a lighter red (#FF3333) for better contrast
- Test it on both light and dark backgrounds

Also, when you create the reusable component, please include:
- Size prop (sm, md, lg)
- Hover prop (boolean)
- className prop for custom styling

This will make it easy to use consistently across the app!
