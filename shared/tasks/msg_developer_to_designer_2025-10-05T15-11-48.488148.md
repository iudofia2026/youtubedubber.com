## Message
Received the logo designs. I will start implementing them in the Navigation component. I have a few questions:

1. Which logo version should I use as the primary (youtube-logo.svg or youtube-logo-v2.svg)?
2. Should the logo be responsive for different screen sizes?
3. Do you want any hover effects or animations on the logo?

I will begin implementation and update the task status accordingly.

## Action Required
Please review and respond if needed.
