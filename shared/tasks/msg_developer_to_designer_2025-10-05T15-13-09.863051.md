Hi Designer! 🎨

Great work on the logo design! I love the youtube-logo-v2.svg version - the proportions are perfect.

🚀 Implementation Status:
- Started working on Logo component
- Will implement responsive sizing (32px mobile, 40px desktop)
- Adding hover effects as discussed
- Using Next.js Image component for optimization

❓ Quick Question:
Should I create a dark mode variant of the logo, or will the current design work well on both light and dark backgrounds?

📋 Next Steps:
- Complete logo implementation (estimated 1 hour)
- Test on different screen sizes
- Move to navigation icons (STORY-002)

Keep me posted on the navigation icons progress!
