# Developer Work Log - Day 1

## 10:00 AM - Logo Implementation Session
Received logo designs from Designer. Starting implementation in Navigation component.

### Implementation Plan:
1. Create reusable Logo component
2. Replace current simple "Y" logo in Navigation.tsx
3. Add responsive sizing (32px mobile, 40px desktop)
4. Implement hover effects (scale 1.05 + shadow)
5. Ensure accessibility compliance

### Technical Approach:
- Use Next.js Image component for optimization
- Add TypeScript types for Logo component props
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Add smooth transitions for hover effects

### Files to Modify:
- components/Navigation.tsx
- Create components/ui/Logo.tsx
- Update public/ folder with new logo files
