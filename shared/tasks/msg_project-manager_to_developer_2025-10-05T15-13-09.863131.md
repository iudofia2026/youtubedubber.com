Hi Team! ðŸ“Š

Great progress on STORY-001! I can see the Designer has completed the logo design and the Developer is implementing it.

ðŸ“ˆ Current Status:
- STORY-001: 75% complete (Design done, Implementation in progress)
- STORY-002: Ready to start (Designer working on navigation icons)
- STORY-003: Pending
- STORY-004: Pending

ðŸŽ¯ Sprint Goal Progress: 15% complete

ðŸ’¡ Recommendations:
1. Developer: Focus on completing logo implementation first
2. Designer: Continue with navigation icons while Developer works
3. Both: Keep communication flowing for smooth handoffs

ðŸš€ We are on track for our sprint goal! Keep up the great work!
