# File Upload System Backend Integration Changes

## Overview
Updated the YT Dubber frontend file upload system to work with the backend's direct upload architecture using Supabase Storage signed URLs.

## Files Modified

### 1. `types/index.ts` - Type Definitions

#### Added New Types:
```typescript
// Enhanced FileUploadProps with upload progress tracking
export interface FileUploadProps {
  // ... existing props ...
  onUploadProgress?: (progress: UploadProgress) => void;
  onUploadComplete?: (file: File) => void;
  onUploadError?: (error: string) => void;
  isUploading?: boolean;
  uploadProgress?: UploadProgress;
}

// New upload progress tracking type
export interface UploadProgress {
  progress: number; // 0-100
  status: 'uploading' | 'processing' | 'validating' | 'complete' | 'error';
  message: string;
  speed?: number; // bytes per second
  estimatedTime?: number; // seconds remaining
  bytesUploaded?: number;
  totalBytes?: number;
}

// Backend API types for signed URL flow
export interface SignedUploadUrls {
  job_id: string;
  upload_urls: {
    voice_track: string;
    background_track?: string;
  };
}

export interface UploadUrlsRequest {
  languages: string[];
  voice_track_name: string;
  background_track_name?: string;
}

export interface JobCreationRequest {
  job_id: string;
  voice_track_uploaded: boolean;
  background_track_uploaded: boolean;
  languages: string[];
}
```

### 2. `lib/api.ts` - API Functions

#### Added New API Functions:
```typescript
// Request signed upload URLs from backend
export const requestSignedUploadUrls = async (request: UploadUrlsRequest): Promise<SignedUploadUrls>

// Upload file directly to Supabase Storage using signed URL with progress tracking
export const uploadFileToStorage = async (
  file: File,
  signedUrl: string,
  onProgress?: (progress: UploadProgress) => void
): Promise<void>

// Notify backend that file uploads are complete
export const notifyUploadComplete = async (request: JobCreationRequest): Promise<SubmitJobResponse>
```

#### Modified Existing Function:
```typescript
// Updated submitDubbingJob to use direct upload flow with progress tracking
export const submitDubbingJob = async (
  data: DubbingJobData,
  onProgress?: (progress: UploadProgress) => void
): Promise<SubmitJobResponse>
```

**Key Changes:**
- Replaced mock implementation with real backend integration
- Added progress tracking using XMLHttpRequest for native browser upload events
- Implemented 4-step process: request URLs ‚Üí upload voice ‚Üí upload background ‚Üí notify backend
- Added comprehensive error handling for duration mismatches and network failures

### 3. `components/LoadingStates.tsx` - Upload Progress Component

#### Enhanced UploadProgress Component:
```typescript
interface UploadProgressProps {
  progress: number;
  fileName: string;
  status: 'uploading' | 'processing' | 'validating' | 'complete' | 'error';
  message?: string;
  speed?: number;
  estimatedTime?: number;
  bytesUploaded?: number;
  totalBytes?: number;
}
```

**Key Changes:**
- Added support for real-time upload progress display
- Added speed and estimated time remaining calculations
- Added bytes uploaded/total bytes display
- Enhanced status icons for complete/error states
- Added color-coded progress bars (green for complete, red for error)

### 4. `components/FileUpload.tsx` - File Upload Component

#### Modified Props Interface:
```typescript
export function FileUpload({ 
  // ... existing props ...
  onUploadProgress,
  onUploadComplete,
  onUploadError,
  isUploading = false,
  uploadProgress
}: FileUploadProps)
```

#### Updated handleFileSelect Function:
```typescript
const handleFileSelect = async (file: File) => {
  // ... validation logic ...
  
  try {
    // Notify parent component about upload start
    onUploadProgress?.({
      progress: 0,
      status: 'validating',
      message: 'Validating file...'
    });

    // Get audio duration for validation
    const audioInfo = await getAudioDuration(file);
    
    // Notify parent component about validation complete
    onUploadProgress?.({
      progress: 100,
      status: 'complete',
      message: 'File validated successfully'
    });
    
    // Call parent callbacks
    onFileSelect(file);
    onDurationChange?.(audioInfo.duration);
    onUploadComplete?.(file);
    
  } catch (error) {
    // ... error handling ...
    onUploadError?.(errorMessage);
  }
};
```

**Key Changes:**
- Removed local upload state management (now handled by parent)
- Added progress callback integration
- Simplified to focus on file validation only
- Added proper error handling with parent callbacks
- Updated progress display to use props instead of local state

### 5. `components/JobCreationWizard.tsx` - Upload Wizard

#### Updated Interface and State:
```typescript
interface JobCreationWizardProps {
  onSubmit: (data: { voiceTrack: File; backgroundTrack?: File; targetLanguages: string[] }) => void;
}

// Updated form data structure
const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
  voiceTrack: null as File | null,
  backgroundTrack: null as File | null,
  targetLanguages: [] as string[], // Changed from single language to array
  voiceTrackDuration: null as number | null,
  backgroundTrackDuration: null as number | null,
});

// Added upload progress tracking
const [uploadProgress, setUploadProgress] = useState<UploadProgress | null>(null);
```

#### Updated handleSubmit Function:
```typescript
const handleSubmit = async () => {
  // ... validation ...
  
  setIsSubmitting(true);
  setUploadProgress({
    progress: 0,
    status: 'processing',
    message: 'Starting upload process...'
  });
  
  try {
    const result = await submitDubbingJob({
      voiceTrack: formData.voiceTrack,
      backgroundTrack: formData.backgroundTrack || undefined,
      targetLanguages: formData.targetLanguages
    }, (progress) => {
      setUploadProgress(progress);
    });
    
    // ... success handling ...
    
  } catch (error) {
    // ... error handling with progress updates ...
  }
};
```

**Key Changes:**
- Changed from single language to multiple languages support
- Added upload progress tracking state
- Integrated with new submitDubbingJob API function
- Added real-time progress updates during upload
- Enhanced error handling with progress feedback

#### Updated Step 3 (Language Selection):
```typescript
// Changed from LanguageSelect to LanguageChecklist for multiple selection
{currentStep === 3 && (
  <div className="space-y-6">
    <LanguageChecklist
      value={formData.targetLanguages}
      onChange={(languages) => setFormData(prev => ({ ...prev, targetLanguages: languages }))}
      languages={LANGUAGES}
    />
    // ... rest of step content ...
  </div>
)}
```

## Backend Integration Flow

### 1. Direct Upload Process:
```
1. User selects files ‚Üí File validation (client-side)
2. Request signed URLs ‚Üí POST /api/jobs/upload-urls
3. Upload voice track ‚Üí Direct to Supabase Storage
4. Upload background track ‚Üí Direct to Supabase Storage (if provided)
5. Notify backend ‚Üí POST /api/jobs (with file metadata)
6. Backend validates duration matching
7. Job created and queued for processing
```

### 2. Progress Tracking:
- **File Validation**: Client-side duration extraction and validation
- **URL Request**: Backend API call for signed URLs
- **File Upload**: Real-time progress using XMLHttpRequest events
- **Backend Notification**: Final job creation step

### 3. Error Handling:
- **Duration Mismatch**: Backend validation with specific error messages
- **Upload Failures**: Network error handling with retry options
- **File Validation**: Client-side validation with user feedback
- **API Errors**: Comprehensive error messages from backend

## Key Benefits

1. **Real-time Progress**: Native browser upload progress tracking
2. **Direct Upload**: Files go directly to Supabase Storage (no backend bottleneck)
3. **Better UX**: Detailed progress information with speed and time estimates
4. **Error Recovery**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
5. **Scalability**: Direct upload reduces backend load
6. **Multiple Languages**: Support for multiple target languages per job

## Backward Compatibility

- All existing props and interfaces maintained
- Graceful fallback for missing progress callbacks
- Existing validation logic preserved
- No breaking changes to parent components

## Testing Considerations

- Test with various file sizes and types
- Test upload progress accuracy
- Test error handling scenarios
- Test duration mismatch validation
- Test multiple language selection
- Test network failure recovery
