## 🔌 Backend Integration Expectations

### Current Mock API (`lib/api.ts`)
The frontend currently uses mock functions that simulate backend behavior:

```typescript
// Current mock functions
submitDubbingJob(data: DubbingJobData): Promise<SubmitJobResponse>
getJobStatus(jobId: string, targetLanguages: string[]): Promise<GetJobStatusResponse>
pollJobStatus(jobId, languages, onProgress, onComplete): () => void
```

### Backend Processing Requirements

The backend must perform the following core workflow:

1. **File Validation & Alignment**
   - Confirm voice track and background track are the same length
   - Validate audio formats and quality
   - Reject jobs if tracks don't match in duration

2. **Audio Processing Pipeline**
   - Extract speech from voice track (speech-to-text)
   - Translate transcript to each target language
   - Generate AI voice in target language (voice cloning/TTS)
   - Align generated voice with original timing
   - Mix translated voice with background track
   - Export properly timed audio files

3. **Output Generation**
   - Per-language voice-only tracks (clean speech)
   - Per-language full mix tracks (voice + background)
   - Maintain exact timing alignment with original

### Expected Backend API Endpoints

#### 1. Job Submission
```http
POST /api/jobs
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

{
  "voice_file": File,        # Voice-only audio track
  "background_file": File,   # Background music/SFX track
  "languages": string[]      # Target language codes
}

Response:
{
  "job_id": "abc123def",
  "status": "validating",
  "message": "Validating audio files...",
  "estimated_duration": 300
}
```

#### 2. Job Status
```http
GET /api/jobs/{job_id}

Response:
{
  "id": "abc123def",
  "status": "processing",  # validating | processing | generating | finalizing | complete | error
  "progress": 45,
  "message": "Generating Spanish dub...",
  "languages": [
    {
      "language_code": "es",
      "language_name": "Spanish",
      "status": "generating",
      "progress": 60,
      "message": "Mixing voice with background...",
      "estimated_time_remaining": 120,
      "download_url": "/api/jobs/abc123def/download?lang=es&type=full"
    }
  ],
  "total_languages": 3,
  "completed_languages": 1,
  "started_at": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z",
  "estimated_completion": "2024-01-01T12:05:00Z",
  "validation_error": null  # If tracks don't match length
}
```

#### 3. File Downloads
```http
GET /api/jobs/{job_id}/download?lang={lang_code}&type={file_type}

Where file_type is one of:
- "voice" (voice-only track in target language)
- "full" (full mix: translated voice + background track)
- "captions" (SRT/VTT file with translated subtitles)
```

#### 4. Validation Error Response
```http
POST /api/jobs
# If voice and background tracks don't match length

Response:
{
  "error": "duration_mismatch",
  "message": "Voice track (120s) and background track (115s) must be the same length",
  "voice_duration": 120.5,
  "background_duration": 115.2
}
```

### Environment Configuration
The frontend expects these environment variables:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000  # Backend API base URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000  # Frontend URL for callbacks
```

## 🔄 Integration Steps

### 1. Replace Mock API
Update `lib/api.ts` to make real HTTP requests:
```typescript
const API_BASE = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL || 'http://localhost:8000';

export const submitDubbingJob = async (data: DubbingJobData): Promise<SubmitJobResponse> => {
  const formData = new FormData();
  formData.append('voice_file', data.voiceTrack);
  if (data.backgroundTrack) {
    formData.append('background_file', data.backgroundTrack);
  }
  formData.append('languages', JSON.stringify(data.targetLanguages));

  const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE}/api/jobs`, {
    method: 'POST',
    body: formData,
  });
  
  if (!response.ok) {
    const error = await response.json();
    if (error.error === 'duration_mismatch') {
      throw new Error(`Audio tracks must be the same length. Voice: ${error.voice_duration}s, Background: ${error.background_duration}s`);
    }
    throw new Error(error.message || 'Failed to submit job');
  }
  
  return response.json();
};
```

### 2. Update Job Status Polling
Replace the mock `simulateJobProgress` with real polling:
```typescript
export const pollJobStatus = (
  jobId: string,
  onProgress: (status: GetJobStatusResponse) => void,
  onComplete: () => void
) => {
  const poll = async () => {
    const status = await getJobStatus(jobId);
    onProgress(status);
    
    if (status.status === 'complete') {
      onComplete();
    } else {
      setTimeout(poll, 2000); // Poll every 2 seconds
    }
  };
  
  poll();
};
```

### 3. Handle File Downloads
Update download links to point to backend endpoints:
```typescript
const downloadUrl = `${API_BASE}/api/jobs/${jobId}/download?lang=${langCode}&type=${fileType}`;
```

## 🚀 Deployment

### Production Environment

1. **Update environment variables**
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_MODE=false
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.youtubedubber.com
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://youtubedubber.com
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-production-project.supabase.co
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_production_anon_key
   ```

2. **Build the application**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Start production server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Vercel Deployment

1. **Connect to Vercel**
   - Import your repository
   - Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard
   - Deploy automatically

2. **Environment Variables in Vercel**

## 🛠️ Development

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Development Issues

**Issue**: `Missing required environment variables: NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`
- **Solution**: Ensure `.env.local` file exists in the frontend directory with required variables
- **Quick Fix**: Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and update values

**Issue**: `Next.js package not found` or Turbopack internal errors
- **Solution**: This has been fixed in the codebase with proper Turbopack configuration
- **If it persists**: Delete `.next` folder and `node_modules`, then run `npm install`

**Issue**: Multiple lockfiles warning
- **Solution**: This has been resolved by removing conflicting `package-lock.json` from root directory
- **Note**: Only the frontend directory should have a `package-lock.json` file

### Code Quality

- **TypeScript** - Strict type checking enabled
- **ESLint** - Code quality and consistency
- **Prettier** - Code formatting (via ESLint)
- **Error Boundaries** - Graceful error handling

### Testing

⚠️ **Important**: Do not run testing commands (`npm test`, `npm run test`) as they cause infinite loops. All development should be done by editing code files directly.

## 🔗 Backend Integration

The frontend is designed to work with the YT Dubber backend API:

### Expected Backend Endpoints
- `POST /api/jobs/upload-urls` - Request signed upload URLs
- `POST /api/jobs` - Create new dubbing job
- `GET /api/jobs/{id}` - Get job status
- `GET /api/jobs/{id}/download` - Download completed files

### API Configuration
The API base URL is configured via `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` environment variable.
