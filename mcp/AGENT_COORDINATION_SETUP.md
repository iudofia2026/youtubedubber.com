# Multi-Agent Frontend Development Setup

## Agent Roles for Frontend Development

### 1. Project Manager Agent
- **Role**: Oversees the entire frontend project, coordinates other agents
- **Responsibilities**: 
  - Project planning and task decomposition
  - Agent coordination and communication
  - Progress tracking and quality assurance
  - Final integration and testing

### 2. Component Architecture Agent
- **Role**: Designs and builds React components
- **Responsibilities**:
  - FileUpload component with drag & drop
  - LanguageSelect component with search
  - ProgressBar component with animations
  - Navigation component
  - Component testing and optimization

### 3. Page Development Agent
- **Role**: Implements Next.js pages and routing
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Home page with hero section
  - Upload form page (/new) with validation
  - Job status page (/jobs/[id]) with progress simulation
  - Page layouts and responsive design

### 4. UI/UX Design Agent
- **Role**: Handles design system and user experience
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Design system implementation (colors, typography, spacing)
  - Framer Motion animations and transitions
  - User experience optimization
  - Visual design and styling

### 5. API Integration Agent
- **Role**: Handles data flow and API integration
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Mock API functions (lib/api.ts)
  - Form submission logic
  - State management
  - Data validation and error handling

### 6. Testing & Quality Agent
- **Role**: Ensures code quality and functionality
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Component testing
  - Integration testing
  - Performance optimization
  - Bug fixing and debugging

## Communication Protocol

### Shared Workspace Structure
```
yt-multilang-dubber/frontend/
├── shared/
│   ├── tasks/
│   │   ├── tasks.json          # Task management
│   │   ├── agent_status.json   # Agent status
│   │   └── handoffs/           # Agent handoffs
│   ├── docs/
│   │   ├── component_specs.md  # Component specifications
│   │   ├── design_system.md    # Design guidelines
│   │   └── api_specs.md        # API documentation
│   └── assets/
│       └── designs/            # Design files and mockups
```

### Agent Handoff Process
1. **Task Assignment**: Project Manager assigns specific tasks to agents
2. **Work Execution**: Agents work on their assigned tasks
3. **Handoff Creation**: When work is complete, create handoff documentation
4. **Integration**: Next agent reviews handoff and continues work
5. **Progress Updates**: Regular status updates in shared workspace

### Task Management
- Each agent has specific, well-defined tasks
- Tasks have clear deliverables and acceptance criteria
- Dependencies between tasks are clearly defined
- Progress is tracked in real-time

## Agent Coordination Commands

### For Project Manager Agent:
```bash
# Check overall project status
python3 check_status.py

# Assign tasks to specific agents
python3 assign_tasks.py

# Create agent handoffs
python3 create_handoff.py
```

### For Individual Agents:
```bash
# Check assigned tasks
python3 my_tasks.py --agent [agent-name]

# Update task status
python3 update_task.py --task [task-id] --status [status]

# Create handoff to next agent
python3 create_handoff.py --from [agent] --to [agent] --task [task-id]
```

## Development Workflow

1. **Project Manager** uses deliberate thinking to plan overall architecture
2. **Project Manager** creates detailed task breakdown
3. **Agents** work in parallel on their assigned tasks
4. **Agents** create handoffs when work is complete
5. **Project Manager** coordinates integration and testing
6. **Final integration** and deployment

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All components built and tested
- [ ] All pages implemented and responsive
- [ ] Mock API functions working
- [ ] Design system implemented
- [ ] Animations and transitions smooth
- [ ] All agents completed their tasks
- [ ] Project runs locally on localhost:3000

## Notes

- Use deliberate thinking for complex decisions
- Maintain clear communication between agents
- Document all handoffs and decisions
- Keep context windows small by delegating specific tasks
- Focus on parallel execution for efficiency
