# MCP Server Usage Guide for YouTube Multilingual Dubber

## Quick Start
Your MCP server is already configured and ready to use! The `deliberatethinking` tool will be available automatically in Claude Code.

## How to Use the MCP Server

### 1. For Planning & Architecture
When starting the project, use deliberate thinking to plan:

```
Use the deliberate thinking tool to analyze:
- What's the best component architecture for this Next.js app?
- How should the file upload flow work from a UX perspective?
- What's the optimal state management approach for this project?
- How can we create a sharp, geometric design system?
```

### 2. For Component Development
For each major component, use deliberate thinking:

```
Use deliberate thinking to plan the FileUpload component:
- What props interface do we need?
- How should drag & drop interactions work?
- What validation states and error handling are needed?
- How can we make the UI feel premium and responsive?
```

### 3. For Problem Solving
When you encounter issues, use deliberate thinking:

```
Use deliberate thinking to debug:
- Why isn't the progress bar animating smoothly?
- How can we improve the form validation UX?
- What's the best way to handle file size validation?
- How can we optimize the component re-renders?
```

### 4. For Design Decisions
Use deliberate thinking for design choices:

```
Use deliberate thinking to decide:
- What's the best color palette for a sharp, modern look?
- How should the typography hierarchy work?
- What animation patterns will feel premium?
- How can we make the UI feel geometric and clean?
```

## Example MCP Workflow

### Step 1: Project Planning
```
Thought 1: "I need to plan the overall architecture for this Next.js app. The key requirements are: file uploads, language selection, job status tracking, and a sharp geometric design."

Thought 2: "For the component hierarchy, I should think about: App layout, page components, form components, and UI components. The file upload is the most complex part."

Thought 3: "The state management should be simple since it's frontend-only. I can use React state for form data and a context for job status if needed."

Thought 4: "For the design system, I need sharp, geometric elements with no rounded corners. This means custom CSS and careful use of Tailwind utilities."
```

### Step 2: Component Planning
```
Thought 1: "The FileUpload component needs to handle drag & drop, file validation, and visual feedback. It should feel premium and responsive."

Thought 2: "Props needed: onFileSelect, accept, maxSize, error, required. I should also include loading and success states."

Thought 3: "For the drag & drop, I'll use HTML5 drag events with visual feedback. The drop zone should have clear visual states for hover, active, and error."

Thought 4: "Validation should be real-time and show clear error messages. File size should be checked immediately, and file type should be validated on selection."
```

## MCP Integration Checklist

- [ ] Use deliberate thinking for project architecture planning
- [ ] Use deliberate thinking for each major component design
- [ ] Use deliberate thinking for complex styling decisions
- [ ] Use deliberate thinking for debugging issues
- [ ] Use deliberate thinking for optimization decisions
- [ ] Use deliberate thinking for user experience improvements

## Benefits of Using MCP

1. **Better Planning**: Break down complex problems systematically
2. **Cleaner Code**: Think through interfaces and data flow before coding
3. **Fewer Bugs**: Debug issues more effectively with structured thinking
4. **Better UX**: Make more thoughtful design and interaction decisions
5. **Maintainable Code**: Plan for future changes and improvements

## Remember

- **Always use deliberate thinking for complex decisions**
- **Don't skip the planning phase** - it saves time later
- **Use it for debugging** - it helps identify root causes
- **Document your thinking** - the MCP tool helps with this
- **Iterate and improve** - use the tool to refine your solutions

The MCP server will make your development process more structured, thoughtful, and effective!
